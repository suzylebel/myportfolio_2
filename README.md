 ## About My Portfolio Project

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio page that will link to our upcoming projects to showcase to the world. This was my first project building code from scratch, but thanks to the help of bootstrap I was able to expedite the process on nav bars to help make the layout of my page better. The 3 programs used on this project were HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. There was a script included at the bottom of the body for js code to make the navigation bar function as it was supposed to. See below the images of the 3 pages from the project. 

*Note: This page will be updated over the week as adjustments are made and projects are added.
