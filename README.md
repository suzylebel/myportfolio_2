 ## About My Portfolio Project

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio page that will link to our upcoming projects to showcase to the world. This was my first project building code from scratch, but thanks to the help of bootstrap I was able to expedite the process on nav bars to help make the layout of my page better. The 3 programs used on this project were HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. There was a script included at the bottom of the body for js code to make the navigation bar function as it was supposed to. See below the images of the 3 pages from the project. 

*Note: This page will be updated over the week as adjustments are made and projects are added. 

The homepage is [index.html]((https://suzylebel.github.io/myportfolio_2/))  
[see code here](https://github.com/suzylebel/myportfolio_2/blob/master/index.html) which is also the about me page. 

I created a container and used columns and rows with the bootstrap css file to expedite the process. The index is where I created the nav bar and would then copy and past it on all 3 pages exactly the same but just changing the respective page to be "active" so it would be highlighted.

The next page is [contact.html](https://suzylebel.github.io/myportfolio_2/contact.html) [see code here.](https://github.com/suzylebel/myportfolio_2/blob/master/contact.html)

The contact page was created with taking various pieces of forms from getbootstrap.com to incorporate in this project. Although it is currently not operational for the purpose of this project it will become functional over time.

This page was rather complex with making sure the images fit in the container and that when the page shrunk the images stacked on top of each other. I need to add padding to the bottom of the container so it doesn't run up against the sticky footer. 

## Continuity on all 3 pages

On all 3 pages the navbar, background image, and sticky footer are the same. The background image was taken from the sample images to complete the exact look requested by our proffesor, John. When the pages are shrunk the navbar has a dropdown bar and is responsive on all of the pages. 



## Tech Used
Built with: 
  -Html
  -CSS
  -Bootstrap
  -JS code from bootstrap for certain functions on HTML

## Code
Using getbootstrap for the nav bar was super helpful as all I did was copy this navbar code from getboostrap.com and deleted a few extra things I didn't need. I undertsand each line of code but I did not have to write each line out! ```<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md bg-light navbar-light">
            <a class="header-name" href= "./index.html">
                <h2>Suzy Le Bel</h2>
            </a>
            <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsibleNavbar">
              <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
            </button>
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse  justify-content-end" id="collapsibleNavbar">
              <ul class="navbar-nav">
                <li class="nav-item">
                  <a class="nav-link" href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
                </li>
                <li class="nav-item">
                  <a class="nav-link active" href="./portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
                </li>
                <li class="nav-item">
                  <a class="nav-link" href="./index.html">About Me</a>
                </li>    
              </ul>
            </div>  
          </nav>```

The .css style page was lots of trail and error, but is organized so that each section is categorized with its corresponding location. 

I used relative path for all images and links.

There is Javascript code from bootstrap located below the footer in each page to have a functioning footer ```<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>```
